Annual Estimates of the Resident Population: April 1, 2010 to July 1, 2013

Note: This is a modified view of the original table.

Note: The estimates are based on the 2010 Census and reflect changes to the April 1, 2010 
population due to the Count Question Resolution program and geographic program revisions. See 
Geographic Terms and Definitions at  
http://www.census.gov/popest/about/geo/terms.html for a list of the states that are 
included in each region and division. All geographic boundaries for the 2013 population 
estimates series except statistical area delineations are as of January 1, 2013. The 
Office of Management and Budget's statistical area delineations for metropolitan, 
micropolitan, and combined statistical areas, as well as metropolitan divisions, are those 
issued by that agency in February 2013
